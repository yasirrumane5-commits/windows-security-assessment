# Windows Security Assessment & Hardening

This project is a hands-on Windows security assessment focused on understanding the default security posture of a Windows system and applying basic hardening techniques using built-in tools.
The goal of this project is not automation or advanced exploitation, but learning how real systems are secured at the baseline level — something every cybersecurity professional must understand before moving forward.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand Windows default security settings
- Identify weak or disabled security configurations
- Apply basic hardening using native Windows features
- Document changes clearly and professionally
- Build a strong beginner-friendly cybersecurity project

## 🧠 Scope of the Project

This project covers the following areas:
- Antivirus & malware protection status
- Firewall configuration (Domain, Private, Public)
- User account and privilege analysis
- App & browser protection settings
- Reputation-based protection assessment
- Basic security hardening steps
- Before-and-after comparison using screenshots
No third-party tools were used. Everything was done using **Windows built-in security features**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Operating System: Windows 11
- Tools Used:
  - Windows Security (Microsoft Defender interface)
  - Windows Firewall
  - Local User Accounts
  - App & Browser Control

## 📋 Methodology

1. Established a **baseline security state** of the system  
2. Documented existing configurations and gaps  
3. Identified potential security risks  
4. Enabled or improved key security features  
5. Captured evidence screenshots after changes  
6. Documented observations in a structured report

## 📸 Evidence

Screenshots included in this repository show:
- Security settings before hardening
- Enabled protection features
- Final secured state of the system

## 🔐 Key Learnings

- Default settings are not always optimal
- Small configuration changes significantly improve security
- Documentation is as important as implementation
- Understanding basics is critical before advanced cybersecurity topics

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was performed on a personal system for **educational purposes only**.
